# machine_learning_practice

This repository holds my practices done during the Machine Learning training courses held by Institute for Information Industry.

The algorithms include:

- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/wangyuhsin/machine_learning_practice/blob/main/practice2_regression.ipynb)
- [Polynomial Regression](https://github.com/wangyuhsin/machine_learning_practice/blob/main/practice2_regression.ipynb)
- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/wangyuhsin/machine_learning_practice/blob/main/practice2_regression.ipynb)
- [K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)](https://github.com/wangyuhsin/machine_learning_practice/blob/main/Supervised_Learning.ipynb)
- [Decision Tree (CART)](https://github.com/wangyuhsin/machine_learning_practice/blob/main/Supervised_Learning.ipynb)
